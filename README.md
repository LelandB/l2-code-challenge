# Leland Bernstein's Submission for the L2 Challenge

## Run (requires npm)
Open a command window to the parent directory l2challenge-react and type 'npm start'

### Added modules: 
- jquery for react (not for DOM manipulation purposes)
- react-bootstrap
- react-bootstrap-table
  

While you can add multiple items to localStorage, you can only delete
one at a time. The app also only fetches the first 25 results from the
search API.
